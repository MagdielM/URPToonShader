# URP Toon Shader

Frustrated by the lack of up-to-date resources regarding custom lighting in Shader Graph as of yet, I decided to write my own toon lit shader for URP. This shader has been tested with Unity 2020.2.3f1 through 2020.2.6f1 and URP 10.3.1. As of right now, it supports albedo and normal maps, custom lighting ramps, rim lighting, and alpha clipping. New features may or may not be added in the future. Releases will be publised as .unitypackage files that can be downloaded from the Releases page.
